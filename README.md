# random-walk-algorithm

Note: this solution is only one of the many potential ones.

The prompt:

Imagine you are given a plot of land to farm that is 10,000 acres. You know nothing about the land. You have 4 seasons a year in which you can plant and 20 different crops to test out to find the optimal planting time, crop and location. Each crop has a different price it sells for, the same cost to farm and a different output depending on the plot of land/time of year in which it is planted. You have the money to run up to 200 tests (one test is planting one acre with one crop in one season) per year
for 10 years. How would you build an algorithm that would suggest the best 200 tests for each year/season period to maximize your profit [output x (price â€“ cost)]? Please provide pseudocode for this exercise along with comments/explanation.
